## Description

  simple-stack-exploit - a simple demo exploit

  NB: be careful when running any of the echoers -- especially the
  server -- so your computer doesn't get exploited unintentionally.

  There are three echoers with slightly different implementations that
  can all be exploited by the `exploit.py` script.  For more
  information, see the source ;-)

  Note that the echoers contain intentional buffer overflows and
  uncontrolled format strings and are compiled without stack
  protection and linked with an executable stack.  Real world exploits
  are (hopefully) a bit more difficult.

```bash
$ cd echoer && make
$ ( ../exploit.py; cat ) | ./echoer1_INSECURE
$ ( ../exploit.py; cat ) | ./echoer2_INSECURE
$ ( ZEROES=yes ../exploit.py; cat ) | ./echoer3_INSECURE
```
